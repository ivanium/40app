ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project
   ShareSDK:D:\ShareSDK-Android-2.8.3-7f3e9044babbb1d78c870d21e9d73308\ShareSDK
   for Android\Libs\MainLibs\.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project ShareSDK: ignored. The project
   may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => shareSDK\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\MobCommons-2017.0412.1554.jar => shareSDK\libs\MobCommons-2017.0412.1554.jar
* libs\MobTools-2017.0412.1554.jar => shareSDK\libs\MobTools-2017.0412.1554.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Core-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Core-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Email-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Email-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Facebook-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-QQ-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-QQ-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-QZone-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-QZone-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-ShortMessage-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-ShortMessage-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-TencentWeibo-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-TencentWeibo-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Twitter-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Twitter-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Core-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Favorite-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Favorite-2.8.3.jar
* libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Moments-2.8.3.jar => shareSDK\libs\ShareSDK-Wechat-Moments-2.8.3.jar
* res\ => shareSDK\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
